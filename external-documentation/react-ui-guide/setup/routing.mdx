title: "Setting up routing"
---


You need to set up page routing to redirect users to different pages based on their search requests or when clicking on a category in the category navigation.

<Note>
    The SDK supports page routing in Next.js applications without any extra configuration. If you're using next.js, [skip to the next step](/react-ui-guide/setup/display-transformers).
</Note>

 However, React.js applications using other routing solutions must use the `navigateFunction` property on the `DepictProvider` wrapper to handle routing to search result pages as shown:

```tsx When using React Router
import { Routes, Route, useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";
import { DepictProvider } from "@depict-ai/react-ui";

function App() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  return (
    <DepictProvider
      merchant="MERCHANT_ID"
      market="MARKET_IDENTIFIER"
      navigateFunction={navigate} // <-- Pass a navigate function here if not using next.js
    >
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" exact element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/search" element={<Search />} />
      </Routes>
    </DepictProvider>
  );
}
```

<Note>
    ðŸ“˜ If using another routing library, you can define your navigation function compatible with React Router's [NavigateFunction](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/hooks/use-navigate#type-declaration) type. (Note: you have to support the `replace` option)
