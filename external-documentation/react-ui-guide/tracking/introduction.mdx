description: "A guide to setting up tracking for Depict UI (React) integrations"
---

For any Depict product that's integrated, it is important to set up tracking so that our product performs correctly. Visit the "Tracking status" tab on [app.depict.ai](https://app.depict.ai) for live feedback on your tracking events.

DPC (Depict Performance Client) is already set up automatically by using `@depict-ai/react-ui`. You can access the DPC instance by doing:

```ts
import { usePerformanceClient } from "@depict-ai/react-ui";

// Where you need it:
const { dpc } = usePerformanceClient();
```

Also the `dpq` global is available after initialising the DepictProvider.

<Note>
  If you are also integrating something via API, for example recommendations,
  make sure to skip the steps where it says you should skip them if you use
  `@depict-ai/react-ui`. Apart from missing the content to be skipped, the
  tracking part of the react and api integration guide are identical.
