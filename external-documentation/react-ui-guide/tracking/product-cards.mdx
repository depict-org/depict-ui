<Warning>
  Only follow these steps for product cards that are NOT rendered through the
  Depict UI (SDK)
</Warning>

We need to tell DPC about the product cards that you created using Depict data. Product cards rendered by Depict components (such as the [SearchPage](/react-ui-guide/search/page)) will automatically have this attached. However, if you render product cards yourself, you need to add a data attribute to the product card.

In the response from all our API:s there's an id inside each display. You need to add this id to your product card template as a data attribute.

The ID is called different things based on different endpoints

| Endpoint you got product data from     | Name of ID in `display` (display = product data provided from API response) | Attribute name to be used      |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| /v3/listings/\*                        | product_listing_result_id                                                   | data-product-listing-result-id |
| /v2/product-listing                    | product_listing_result_id                                                   | data-product-listing-result-id |
| /v3/recommend/products                 | recommendation_id                                                           | data-recommendation-id         |
| /v2/recommend/\*                       | recommendation_id                                                           | data-recommendation-id         |
| /v3/search/\*                          | search_result_id                                                            | data-search-result-id          |
| /v2/search/related, /v2/search/results | search_result_id                                                            | data-search-result-id          |

This step enables DPC to add click tracking to the product cards as well as tracking when the product card is visible to the user according to certain criteria.

## Examples:

#### Recommendations:

```html
<div data-recommendation-id="7ad3110d-7cd6-4352-83da-b93fa1bfe645">
  <!-- Product card -->
</div>
```

#### Recommendations:
