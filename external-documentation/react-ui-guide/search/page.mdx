title: "Adding the SearchPage to your site"

The next step is to add the `SearchPage` component to the search results page you created, on the URL matching the `searchPagePath`. `SearchPage` is the component that will be used to display the search results.

You will need to add the product card you created in [a previous step](/react-ui-guide/setup/product-card) here.

An example looks like this:

```tsx
import { SearchPage } from "@depict-ai/react-ui";
import { ProductCard } from "../../components/ProductCard";

export default function SearchResultsPage() {
  return (
    <main>
      <SearchPage productCard={ProductCard} />
    </main>
  );
}
```

Use the `columnsAtSize` prop to handle breakpoints on your search results page. It defines the number of product card columns displayed at each screen size.
