Expand and use one or multiple of the following examples to add a way to open the SearchModal.

See [overview](/react-ui-guide/search/overview) for a disambiguation of the different search components.

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Open centered modal">
        ```tsx
        import React from "react";
        import { useSearchModal } from "@depict-ai/react-ui";

        const Component = () => {
          const { open } = useSearchModal({
            location: "centered",
          });

          return (
            <div>
              <button onClick={open}>Search</button>
            </div>
          );
        };
```
    </Accordion>


    <Accordion title="Open aligned modal">
      ```tsx
      import React from "react";
      import { ComponentAligner, useSearchModal } from "@depict-ai/react-ui";

      const App = () => {
        const ref = React.createRef();

        const { open } = useSearchModal({
          location: "aligned",
          alignerRef: ref,
        });

        return (
          <div>
            <ComponentAligner ref={ref} />{/* You can also pass the ref to any other existing element you want to align to, ComponentAligner is just a div with height: 100% */}
            <button onClick={open}>Search</button>
          </div>
        );
      };
      ```
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Render a SearchField that opens a modal aligned to the SearchField itself:">
        ```tsx
        import React from "react";
        import { useSearchField } from "@depict-ai/react-ui";

        const Component = () => {
          const { SearchField } = useSearchField();

          return (
           <div>
              <SearchField />
           </div>
          );
        };
        ```
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Render a SearchField that opens a modal aligned to another DOM element">
```tsx
import React from "react";
import { ComponentAligner, useSearchField } from "@depict-ai/react-ui";

const Component = () => {
  const ref = useRef(null);
  const { SearchField } = useSearchField({
    alignerRef: ref
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <ComponentAligner ref={ref} />{/* You can also pass the ref to any other existing element you want to align to, ComponentAligner is just a div with height: 100% */}
      <SearchField />
    </div>
  );
};
```
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
    ðŸ“˜ **Modal alignment on smaller screens**

    When the viewport height is below 900px, the search modal will overlook the element reference passed to the `alignerRef` property and center the search modal to the top of the viewport. This is to use the available space as efficiently as possible.
