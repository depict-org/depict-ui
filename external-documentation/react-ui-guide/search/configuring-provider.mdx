title: "Configuring the DepictProvider for your search page"
---

<Warning>
This page does not apply to installs made in 2025 or later of the Depict Shopify apps
</Warning>

Go back to where you implemented the DepictProvider and add the following configuration option:

```tsx
 search={{
   searchPagePath: "SEARCH_RESULTS_PAGE_PATH",
}}
```

Where `SEARCH_RESULTS_PAGE_PATH` is the path to the page where you want to display the search results, for example `/sv/search`.

<Warning>
    📘 The `searchPagePath` value must match the route path for your application's search page component - after any redirects. Meaning it has to include the "market" if the URL will include that.
</Warning>

See the `DepictProvider` [reference](/reference/search-sdk/search-react-sdk#the-depictprovider-component) for more information.
