The search modal is what's used to make a search and get to the results page. You need to add a way for the user to open the modal.

There are three ways to do this:

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Option 1: Re-using your existing search button">
        <Steps>
            <Step title="First Step">
                Remove any event listeners from your existing search button so that nothing happens when clicking it
            </Step>
            <Step title="Second Step">
                Add the `open-depict-search` class to your search button to make it open the Depict search modal.
            </Step>
            <Step title="Done">
                Clicking the search button should now open the Depict search modal.

    <Accordion title="Option 3: Adding a Depict search field">
        If you prefer a visible search field in your header instead of just a button, there is a "Depict Search Field" block that you can use which will automatically align and connect to the modal.

<Tip>Now that you have added the Depict search to your site, we recommend removing all traces (including JavaScript) of your old search to improve pagespeed.</Tip>


## Optional: Alignment options

When using the <b>search field</b>, the modal will automatically align to the SearchField (landscape modal) or align to it initially and then animate the X-direction to be centered (portrait modal).

When using a <b>search button</b>, there are two different alignment modes available, provided you're using the landscape search modal:

<b>One advantage of aligning the modal to the button is that the position of the modal won't shift as the content in it changes.</b>

### Enabling the vertically-aligned-to-button mode

1. When re-using your existing search button, add `data-align-to-self="true"` to the element.
2. When using the "Depict Search Button"-block, check the "enable button to modal in y-axis" box in the block settings
