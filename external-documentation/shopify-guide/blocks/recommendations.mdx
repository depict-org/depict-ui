There are two types of blocks available for recommendations:

1. Grid (with or without a "view more" button)
2. Slider

They can be added to either:
1. The product page
2. The front page
3. The cart page

Here's an example how to add a grid of recommendations to the product page:

                // In prod, they have some zoom thing which breaks aspectRatio, work around that. Unfortunately this is not in the SSR'd output so there's still some CLS.
                const direct_parent = element?.parentElement;
                if(direct_parent?.matches?.("[data-rmiz-content]")) {
                    Object.assign(direct_parent.style, {
                        width: "100%",
                        display: "flex",
