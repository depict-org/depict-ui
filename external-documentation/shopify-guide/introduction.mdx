<Warning>
This page does not apply to installs made in 2025 or later of the Depict Shopify apps
</Warning>

We will guide you through your integration with Depict and the Depict UI, enabling you to offer a high-quality user experience with a swift integration.

Currently, you can integrate all three products with our shopify app:
1. [Collections](/shopify-guide/blocks/collection-page)
2. [Search](/shopify-guide/blocks/search-page)
3. [Recommendations](/shopify-guide/blocks/recommendations)

If you’re only integrating one of them, skip the section that doesn’t apply to you. The “setup” section applies to all.
