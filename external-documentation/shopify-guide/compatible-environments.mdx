title: "Compatibility and Browser Support of the Depict Shopify App"

## Shopify compatbility

Our app is compatible with Shopify and Shopify plus stores, but your shopify website can't be headless.<br />
If your site is headless, you will need to contact us to get help with the data ingestion and can then integrate with our [JavaScript UI](/js-ui-guide/introduction), [React UI](/react-ui-guide/introduction) or the [API](/api-guide/introduction).

### Shopify V1

If your store is on Shopify V1, you will need to update the templates of the pages where you want to add Depict blocks to Shopify V2. [This guide should help](https://shopify.dev/docs/themes/os20/migration).


## Browser support

We ship modern JavaScript to modern browsers and legacy JavaScript to legacy browsers, currently with support down until iOS 13.4. Let us know if you have a considerable number of users that need support for even older browsers.
