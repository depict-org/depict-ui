1. Where you construct your searchProvider, import and pass in the `ClassicSearchModal` as the `searchModalComponent` property.
```tsx
import { ClassicSearchModal } from "@depict-ai/js-ui";

const searchProvider = new DepictSearchProvider<YourDisplay>({
  // … other properties
  searchModalComponent: ClassicSearchModal,
});
```
3. Where you import the Depict UI SCSS, set the `$search-modal-layout` variable to `"classic"`.
```scss
@use "@depict-ai/js-ui" with ($search-modal-layout: "classic");
```


<Accordion title="A note about bundle size (Advanced)">
    Because the new search modal is the default, it can't be tree-shaken by default. However, if you want to use the old search modal and not have the new one included in your bundle, you can do the following:

    1. Set up your build system so you can inline/substitute envirnoment variables into your code. For example, with webpack, you can use the [DefinePlugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/define-plugin/).
    2. Ensure the expression `process.env.NO_SEARCH_MODAL_DEFAULT` becomes substituted to `"true"` (if you use parcel you can just set the environment variable `NO_SEARCH_MODAL_DEFAULT` to `true` while building), this leads to your minifier being able to remove the new search modal from the bundle.
