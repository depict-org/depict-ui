## Dynamic collections


One of Depict's features is to allow you to create 100s of collection pages showcasing different groups of products.

This poses a problem for sites that rely on a CMS to determine which pages exists or not.

This section provides examples on how to handle dynamic collections on your site. However, it will differ depending on your setup.

<Warning>
  All examples assume you have a `DepictProvider` in your app, see:
  * [React](/react-ui-guide/setup/depict-provider)
  * [Vanilla JS](/js-ui-guide/listings/provider)
</Warning>

Use the left side menu to choose your CMS and framework.
