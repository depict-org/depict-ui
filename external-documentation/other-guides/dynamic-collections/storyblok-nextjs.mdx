title: "Storyblok + NextJS"
---

To avoid having to create a Story in Storyblok for each collection, we can make use of NextJS dynamic routing.

<Note>This example assumes you are using the NextJS [Pages Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages) when we mention file names and their locations</Note>

Let's say you want all collections to be displayed under the `/collections` route. You can create a file called `[...slug].js` in a `collections` folder under `pages`.

<Note>Make sure you have the `fallback` option set to `true` in your `getStaticPaths` function, otherwise NextJS will not render the page on the fly</Note>

For details on `ProductCard` and `CategoryPage` see the [Product Card](/react-ui-guide/setup/product-card) and [Category Page](/react-ui-guide/listings/page) instructions.

You have two examples below:

The first and recommended way is that you check if the page has been configured in the Storyblok Visual Editor, and if so, render the Story before the `CategoryPage` component.
Otherwise, render the `CategoryPage` component directly. This will allow anyone using Storyblok to provide template overrides for specific collections.

The second way is a minimal setup, where you only render the `CategoryPage` component. This is useful if you don't want to allow template overrides for specific collections.
