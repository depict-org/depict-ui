This page describes how Centra customers can import their product data to Depict and keep it up to date. 

Depict integrates directly to the Centra GraphQL API to get the required information. You must provide your Centra API base URL and a GraphQL Access Token with sufficient read permissions. Once linked, your product data is immediately imported into Depict's systems and synchronised periodically to reflect any changes.

### Setup steps

1. Obtain your GraphQL Access Token as outlined in the [Centra documentation](https://docs.centra.com/api-references/graphql-integration-api/authorization#graphql-access-token).
2. Ensure the GraphQL Access Token has the required permissions.
3. Provide both your Centra **API URL** and the **access token** to Depict.
