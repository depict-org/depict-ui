Depict uses historical purchase data to understand your product collection. The data we require includes transaction data and anonymised user information. You can provide this by giving Depict view-level access to your Google Analytics account.

To do this, follow the steps described in the [Google Analytics Documentation](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1009702). Grant permission to Depict's Google Analytics email address — `ga@depict.ai`
