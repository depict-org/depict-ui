This page describes how customer can import their product data to Depict and keep it up to date. 

If you use one of our supported platforms (Centra & Shopify), it is recommended that you use a platform integration instead. 

### Setup steps

1. Setup feeds matching the specifications:
    - [Product Feed](/reference/data-ingestion/product-feed-specification)
    - [Category Feed](/reference/data-ingestion/category-feed-specification)
2. Setup a export of your product data in this feed format.
3. Share the URL where the feed can be accessed with Depict.

<Note>
Depict can only update product data after your feed updates. To not cause outdated info to be visible on the site, please make sure to have a quick feed refresh time.

Your feed should at least update every hour, but ideally every 10 minutes.
