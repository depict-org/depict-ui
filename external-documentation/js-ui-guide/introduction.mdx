description: "A guide for integrating with the plain JavaScript flavour of the Depict UI"
---

<Note>We recently released v3 of the Depict UI, this guide has been updated. See the [migration guide](/other-guides/sdk-migration-v2-v3) on how v3 differs from v2.</Note>

We will guide you through your integration with the Depict UI, enabling you to offer a high-quality user experience with a swift integration.

Currently, you can integrate three products with Depict UI (JavaScript):

1. Search
2. Product listing pages
3. Recommendations

If you're only integrating one of them, skip the section that doesn't apply to you. The "setup" section applies to all.

<Tip>Remember to follow the [tracking](/js-ui-guide/tracking) guide</Tip>
