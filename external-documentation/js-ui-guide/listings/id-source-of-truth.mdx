We want you to be able to create all sorts of product listing pages inside the Depict portal ([app.depict.ai](https://app.depict.ai)), like brand pages, category pages, campaign pages and collections.

For the next step, you will need to provide to the `CategoryPage` function what page it should show, in the form of an ID. And the type of that ID depends on the setup the merchant has chosen.

For each [product listing page](/reference/glossary/types-of-listing-pages):

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Option 1: Depict owns the listing">
        Depict is what decides that this listing page exists. Your page's menu/navigation and routing gets the information from Depict's [Get Listings API](https://api.depict.ai/docs#tag/Listing-(v3)/operation/Get_Listings_v3_listings_get). This means adding a new category or brand page in the Depict portal will automatically make it available in your menu/navigation and routing.

        Pros:
        - Works with all types of listing pages
        - You get full support for re-arranging the category hierarchy in the Depict portal

        Cons:
        - Need to re-implement menu/navigation and routing if already implemented using another source of truth (e.g. Centra)

        You will provide listing ids to the `DepictCategory` class as `listingQuery` in the format of:

    ```json
    {
        "type": "listingId",
        "id": "cbf88de7-86cb-49d0-93a7-34fb2b2029fb"
    }
    ```
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Option 2: Your PIM owns the listing">
    You retain your PIM as source of truth for your routing and for rendering the menu/navigation elements of your page.

    Pros:
        - Don't need to re-implement menu/navigation and routing using Depict

    Cons:
        - Does not work <i>at all</i> for listings that can't be requested with `externalId` [see table](/reference/glossary/types-of-listing-pages).

        You will provide external ids to the `DepictCategory` class as `listingQuery` in the format of:

    ```json
    {
        "type": "externalId",
        "id": "135"
    }
    ```

    </Accordion>
