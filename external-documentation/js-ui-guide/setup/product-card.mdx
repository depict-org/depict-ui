## Requirements

For both search and product listing pages, you need to set up your product card component.

We call the product data that you receive for each product card that you have to render `display`.
That component will receive a `display` of the type `YourDisplay | null`.
`YourDisplay` is a type definition of your specific display. Please ask Depict for this.

If `display` is `null`, it means that there's no data for this product card yet, and you should display <b>a product card as close to the dimensions as the one you'll display when you'll have data</b>, we'll call this a "placeholder". The placeholder serves as a loading indicator for users as well as enabling scroll restoration when going back and minimizing content shift.

The `productCard` component has to return a `HTMLElement` or `HTMLElement[]`.

## Example expected output of your product card component

<CardGroup cols={2}>
    <Frame caption="`display` is `null`">
        <img src="/images/placeholder.svg" style={{ aspectRatio: 457/903, width: "100%"}} ref={element => {
        // In prod, they have some zoom thing which breaks aspectRatio, work around that. Unfortunately this is not in the SSR'd output so there's still some CLS.
        const direct_parent = element?.parentElement;
        if(direct_parent?.matches?.("[data-rmiz-content]")) {
            Object.assign(direct_parent.style, {
                width: "100%",
                display: "flex",
                justifyContent: "center",
                alignItems: "center"
            })
        }
        const parents_parent = direct_parent?.parentElement;
        if(parents_parent?.matches?.("[aria-owns^='rmiz-modal']")) {
            parents_parent.style.width = "100%";
        }
        }} />
    </Frame>

    <Frame caption="`display` is `HoudiniDisplay`">
        <img src="/images/product_card.svg" style={{ aspectRatio: 469/928, width: "100%"}} ref={element => {
        // In prod, they have some zoom thing which breaks aspectRatio, work around that. Unfortunately this is not in the SSR'd output so there's still some CLS.
        const direct_parent = element?.parentElement;
        if(direct_parent?.matches?.("[data-rmiz-content]")) {
            Object.assign(direct_parent.style, {
                width: "100%",
                display: "flex",
                justifyContent: "center",
                alignItems: "center"
            })
        }
        const parents_parent = direct_parent?.parentElement;
        if(parents_parent?.matches?.("[aria-owns^='rmiz-modal']")) {
            parents_parent.style.width = "100%";
        }
        }} />
    </Frame>
</CardGroup>


## Provided Placeholder components

You can use the `ImagePlaceholder` component to display a placeholder image while the product image is loading.
You can use the `TextPlaceholder` component to display a placeholder text while the product title or price is loading.

[Read the reference for more information](/reference/listings-search/placeholder-components).

## Displaying color swatches

```ts
export interface YourDisplay {
  /**
  * The index of the variant to show in the variant_displays array
  */
  variant_index: number;
  /**
  * All variants for that product - here you can, for example, get the color of each variant to display color swatches
  */
  variant_displays: YourVariantDisplay[];
  // â€¦ other properties
}
```

## Code example

You probably have an existing product card which you just can add placeholder functionality for. Here's an example of how it could look like:

<Tip>"Why is this JSX? I'm not using react!" - Did you miss the [previous page?](/js-ui-guide/setup/setting-up-jsx)</Tip>

```tsx
import { ImagePlaceholder, TextPlaceholder } from "@depict-ai/js-ui";


export function ProductCard({ display }: { display: null | YourDisplay }) {
  const variant_to_show = display?.variant_displays[display?.variant_index];

  return [
    <a
      href={variant_to_show?.page_url || "#"}
      class="rec-outer"
      {...(variant_to_show && "recommendation_id" in variant_to_show
        ? { "data-recommendation-id": variant_to_show.recommendation_id }
        : {})}
    >
      {variant_to_show ? (
        <div class="image-container">
          {/* Use the first image in image_urls as the default image */}
          <img class="default-image" src={variant_to_show.image_urls[0]} />
          {/* Use the second image in image_urls as the hover image */}
          <img class="hover-image" src={variant_to_show.image_urls[1]} />
        </div>
      ) : (
        <ImagePlaceholder aspectRatio={imgAspectRatio} />
      )}

      <div class="text-container">
        <div class="rec-title">
          {variant_to_show.title ?? <TextPlaceholder height="1em" width="20ch" />}
        </div>
        <div class="price-container">
          <span class="price">
            {variant_to_show ? (
              <FormatPrice price={variant_to_show.sale_price} />
            ) : (
              <TextPlaceholder height="1em" width="5ch" />
            )}
          </span>
        </div>
      </div>
    </a>,
  ];
}
```

<Note>Note how we branch off to the shimmering placeholder effect in place of the content, when there is no content</Note>
