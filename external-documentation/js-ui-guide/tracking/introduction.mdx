For any Depict product that's integrated, it is important to set up tracking so that our product performs correctly. Visit the "Tracking status" tab on [app.depict.ai](https://app.depict.ai) for live feedback on your tracking events.

This guide will walk you through the steps to set up tracking for your Depict project using DPC (Depict Performance Client).

<Warning>
  This guide is for when you're using the `js-ui` package. See the API or React
  guides if you're integrating with them instead.
</Warning>
