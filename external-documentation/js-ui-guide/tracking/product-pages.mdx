description: "How to make sure DPC tracks your Product Details Page (PDP) views correctly."

<Note>
  For attribution of purchases to work properly, the product ID used in
  `setProductId` and `addToCart` events must be the same type of id that is
  returned in the displays by our API as `product_id`. For an example of valid
  product IDs, see the bottom table on the "Tracking status" tab on
  [app.depict.ai](https://app.depict.ai).
</Note>

Every time after navigating to a page representing a product on your website, you need to send a `setProductId` event to register which product id is currently viewed.

<CodeGroup>

```typescript dpq
dpq("setProductId", "[PRODUCT_ID_FOR_CURRENT_PDP]");
```

```typescript DPC instance
dpc.setProductId("[PRODUCT_ID_FOR_CURRENT_PDP]");
```
