title: "Rendering recommendations in a grid"
---

To render recommendations in a grid, do the following:

1. Fetch recommendations, see: [this excerpt of the API integration guide](/api-guide/recommendations/api-client/fetching).
2. Render the recommendations using the `RecommendationGrid` function.

```ts
import {
  RecommendationGrid,
  onExistsObserver,
  fetchDepictRecommendations,
} from "@depict-ai/js-ui";

const recommendations = fetchDepictRecommendations({
  merchant: "MERCHANT_ID",
  market: "MARKET", // See demo.depict.ai for available markets
  locale: "en_GB", // See demo.depict.ai for available locales
  type: "TYPE",
  // click the link above for more information on the options here
});

const recommendationGrid = RecommendationGrid({
  recommendations,
  productCard, // The productCard component you created in a previous step
});

onExistsObserver("#frontpage-recommendations", (element) =>
  element.append(recommendationGrid)
);
```
