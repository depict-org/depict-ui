title: "Naming discrepancies"
---

Unfortunately, there are currently some naming discrepancies between the code and the docs.

We will look into aligning the code with the docs in the next major release, but for now, please note the following:

| Name in Docs                   | Name in Code                                    | What                                                                                                                                                               |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| PLP (Product Listing Page)     | Category page (or "category & collection page") | Page primarily listing products based on something other than a search query, see [different types of supported pages](/reference/glossary/types-of-listing-pages) |
| Search page                    | Search page                                     | Page primarily listing products based on a search query                                                                                                            |
| Search or Product Listing Page | PLP                                             | "Product Listing Pages" verbatim - a page primarily listing products, whether by a search query or something else.                                                 |
