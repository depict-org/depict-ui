title: "Category Feed Specification"
---

We support feeds as JSON, CSV or XML. The feed should be refreshed at least every hour - otherwise it will take too much time for your product updates to take effect on your site.

<Note>
ðŸ“˜ **One feed per market**

If your site has multiple markets, you need to provide a product feed for each of them. Each feed should then contain the correct URLs and translations for that market.
