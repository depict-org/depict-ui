title: "Customising price formatting"
---

Price formatting can be customised as part of the `locale` property on the provider that you're using. The price formatting customised according to this article will be reflected in the price filter, number formatting of the number of results/products and in the prices in the SearchModal. You are responsible yourself for the price formatting in your `productCard`.

The type looks as follows:

```ts
type PriceFormatting = {
    pre_: string;
    post_: string;
    decimal_places_delimiter_: string;
    thousands_delimiter_: string;
    places_after_comma_: number | "auto";
}
```

The default value is:

```ts
({
    pre_: "",
    post_: "",
    decimal_places_delimiter_: ".",
    thousands_delimiter_: ",",
    places_after_comma_: 2
})
```

To customise it, spread it into the locale you're importing.

Example:

<CodeGroup>
```tsx React
import { DepictProvider } from "@depict-ai/react-ui";
import { en } from "@depict-ai/react-ui/locales";
import { YourDisplay } from "./display-types.ts"

function App() {
  return (
    <DepictProvider<YourDisplay>
      merchant="MERCHANT_ID"
      market="MARKET"
      locale={{
        ...en,
        price_formatting_: {
          pre_: "",
          post_: "kr",
          decimal_places_delimiter_: ",",
          thousands_delimiter_: " ",
          places_after_comma_: "auto",
        },
      }}
    >
      <div className="App">...</div>
    </DepictProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

```ts Vanilla JavaScript
import { DepictSearchProvider } from "@depict-ai/js-ui";
import { en } from "@depict-ai/js-ui/locales";
import { YourDisplay } from "./display-types.ts"

const searchProvider = new DepictSearchProvider<YourDisplay>({
  merchant: "MERCHANT_ID",
  market: "MARKET",
  searchPagePath: "PATH_TO_SEARCH_PAGE",
  locale: {
    ...en,
    price_formatting_: {
      pre_: "",
      post_: "kr",
      decimal_places_delimiter_: ",",
      thousands_delimiter_: " ",
      places_after_comma_: "auto",
    },
  },
});

```
