## RecommendationGrid component

Renders a grid of product cards, to be used for displaying recommendations.
See [this guide](/api-guide/recommendations/introduction) for how to fetch recommendations to provide as `recommendations`.

The following table shows the `RecommendationGrid`'s configuration properties, their types, and descriptions:

<ResponseField name="recommendations" type="Promise<T[]>">
  A promise resolving to an array of recommendations/displays.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="productCard" type="React.Element<typeof Component>">
  The React component to use for rendering products.
</ResponseField>

    vertical: string;
})?"

>
  The spacing between the product cards.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField
    name="maxRows"
    type="number?"
>
    The number of rows to limit the grid to. Won't work if columnsAtSize is an empty array as it is used to calculate the number of rows dynamically depending on screen size.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField
  name="columnsAtSize"
  type="[number, number?][]?"
  default="[[2, 901], [3, 1024], [4]]"
>
  How many columns to show at each media size. For example, `[[2, 901], [3,
  1024], [4]]` means 2 columns at sizes up to 901px, 3 columns at sizes up to
  1024px and after that 4 columns at any viewport size.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField
  name="viewMoreButton"
  type="{ text: string; startRows?: number; rowsPerClick?: number; }?"
>
  Optional configuration for the view more button. If unset, all products will
  be shown by default. Otherwise, a view more button with the given text will be
  shown. With the properties startRows and rowsPerClick, you can configure how
  many rows should be shown initially and how many rows should be added on each
  click.
</ResponseField>

<Tip>
  Looking for a translation for the view more button? The locales exported from
  `@depict-ai/react-ui/locales` should have a `view_more_` property that you can
  use.
