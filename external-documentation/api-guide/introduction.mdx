<Warning>
This page does not apply to installs made in 2025 or later of the Depict Shopify apps
</Warning>

If you want more control over the UX implementation you can use the Depict APIs directly, instead of the pre-built [Depict UI SDK](/react-ui-guide/introduction).
We still recommend you to use the [DPC library](/reference/performance-client/introduction-to-depict-performance-client) for tracking.

1. [Recommendations](/api-guide/recommendations/introduction)
2. [Search](/reference/search-listing-apis/search-overview)
3. [Product Listing Pages](/reference/search-listing-apis/listing-pages)

<Info>For all the guides above, don't forget to follow the [tracking](/api-guide/tracking) guide</Info>

You can follow these guides independently and mix and match which products you want to integrate with API or the Depict UI.

<Tip>If you are using typescript you can see all [API type definitions here](https://unpkg.com/browse/@depict-ai/types@latest/api/)</Tip>
