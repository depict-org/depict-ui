We provide two ways to use the API:
1. [With our JavaScript API client (recommended)](/api-guide/recommendations/api-client)
2. [By making the requests yourself](/api-guide/recommendations/api)

To experiment with what recommendations are available for you and see queries made in action, checkout the [preview browser](https://demo.depict.ai/null/null/recommendations?headers=%7B%22force-new-displays%22%3A%221%22%7D).
