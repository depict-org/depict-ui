Add the following to the beginning of the file where you want to use the `fetchDepictRecommendations` function:

<CodeGroup>
    ```typescript js-ui
    import { fetchDepictRecommendations } from "@depict-ai/js-ui";
    ```
    ```typescript react-ui
    import { useFetchRecommendations } from "@depict-ai/react-ui";

    // Then, in your component where you want to use fetchRecommendations:
    const { fetchRecommendations } = useFetchRecommendations();
    // You don't have to specify `merchant` and `market` to the `fetchRecommendations` function that you get from `useFetchRecommendations`.
    // Since that will be taken from the provider automatically.
    ```
</CodeGroup>
