The `fetchDepictRecommendations` function takes an object of options as its argument, and returns a promise of an array of so-called displays (product data). [Reference](/reference/recommendations-sdk/recommendations-sdk-api-wrapper).

<Info>Regarding MERCHANT_ID and MARKET, see [the comments here](/api-guide/tracking/initialising)</Info>
<Tip>For a list of possible types, try checking the [preview browser](https://demo.depict.ai/null/null/recommendations?headers=%7B%22force-new-displays%22%3A%221%22%7D) or ask your Depict contact. Usually the available types are also detailed in the kickoff slides. If you get `{"error":"(tenant, market, type) not yet configured. Please contact Depict."}` that probably means a type isn't available for you - let us know if you want it.</Tip>

### Fetching general recommendations:

General recommendations are recommendations that aren't related to any particular content but specific to the type of page.
Most often, these are recommendations for the front page.

```typescript TypeScript
const frontPageRecs = await fetchDepictRecommendations({
    merchant: "MERCHANT_ID",
    market: "MARKET",
    type: "TYPE",
});
```

### Fetching recommendations for one specific product

Use this if you want to fetch recommendations for a specific product. For example, if you want to show recommendations below the description on a product page.

```typescript TypeScript
const productPageRecs = await fetchDepictRecommendations({
    merchant: "MERCHANT_ID",
    market: "MARKET",
    type: "TYPE",
    productId: "this-is-an-amazing-product",
});
```

### Fetching recommendations for multiple products

Use this if you want to fetch recommendations for multiple products, e.g., for everything a user has in their cart.

```typescript TypeScript
const cartRecs = await fetchDepictRecommendations({
    merchant: "MERCHANT_ID",
    market: "MARKET",
    type: "TYPE",
    productIds: ["product-1", "product-2", "product-3"],
});
```
