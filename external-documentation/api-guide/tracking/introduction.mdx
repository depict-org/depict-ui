For any Depict product that's integrated, it is important to set up tracking so that our product performs correctly. Visit the "Tracking status" tab on [app.depict.ai](https://app.depict.ai) for live feedback on your tracking events.

This guide will walk you through the steps to set up tracking for your Depict project using DPC (Depict Performance Client).

<Note>
  If you are also using `@depict-ai/react-ui` only do the step [Product Card
  Tracking](/api-guide/tracking/product-cards) and onwards.
