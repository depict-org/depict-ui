<Warning>If you are also using `@depict-ai/react-ui`, skip this step.</Warning>

The second step is to import DPC. For the first two options below, add the following to <u>the top of the file where you want to use DPC</u>:

<CodeGroup>
```ts ESM
import { DPC } from "@depict-ai/dpc";
```

```ts CommonJS
const { DPC } = require("@depict-ai/dpc");
```

```html Not using a module bundler
<script type="module">
    import { DPC } from "https://esm.run/@depict-ai/dpc@1.0/ES10";
    // CODE THAT INITIALISES DPC (SEE NEXT STEP) MUST GO HERE
</script>
```
</CodeGroup>
