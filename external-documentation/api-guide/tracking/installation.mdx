<Warning>
This page does not apply to installs made in 2025 or later of the Depict Shopify apps

<Warning>If you are also using `@depict-ai/react-ui`, skip this step.</Warning>

The first step is to add the DPC dependency to your project. You can do this by running:

<CodeGroup>

```shell NPM
npm i @depict-ai/dpc
```

```shell Yarn
yarn add @depict-ai/dpc
```
</CodeGroup>


If you're using `@depict-ai/js-ui`, DPC is also re-exported from it, and you can thus skip this step if you import DPC from `@depict-ai/js-ui` in the next step, instead of `@depict-ai/dpc`.

If you do not use a module bundler, you can also include DPC from a CDN. In that case, skip this step.
