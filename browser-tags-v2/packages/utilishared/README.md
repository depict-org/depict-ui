What do you think about renaming @depict-ai/shared to @depict-ai/utilities ?
14:41
It basically contains random utilities
14:42
IMO "shared" says less. Shared between what? Other npm packages. But aren't all npm packages shared between other packages?

it's a bit of a convention i guess with shared, I took inspiration from vue https://github.com/vuejs/core/tree/main/packages/shared
14:44
no strong preference, but utilities is annoying to type :wink:
14:44

Daniel

Omg it would be so funny to create a type speed test where you only have to type utilities
